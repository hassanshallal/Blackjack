# Blackjack
Blackjack: object-oriented C++ implementation of a blackjack backend (Project after C++ introductory MIT online class)

So, I worked on this project after completing the Introducion to C++ MIT class (https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-096-introduction-to-c-january-iap-2011/).

This is my first time using object-oriented design and writing C++ code, so please feel free to ask any question in case you have any.

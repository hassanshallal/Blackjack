# Blackjack
Blackjack: object-oriented C++ implementation of a blackjack backend (Project after C++ introductory MIT online class)

So, I worked on this project after completing the Introducion to C++ MIT class (https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-096-introduction-to-c-january-iap-2011/).

This is my first time using object-oriented design and writing C++ code, so please feel free to ask any question in case you have any.


In order to playe the game, you need to compile first:
1) Change directory to the folder containing the main.cpp, Blackjack.cpp, and Blackjack.h files
2) Type the following command to compile and link: g++ main.cpp Blackjack.cpp -o Blackjack.o
3) Type the following command to play: ./Blackjack.o
